<p class="model-summarize">
<strong style="color:red">In "How to Heal a Hypochondriac"(Time, September 30, 2003), Michael Lemonick reports on research into ways of dealing with hypochondria, a thinking disorder that makes healthy people believe that they are suffering from one or more serious diseases. </strong>
<strong style="color:black">Not only do hypochondriacs genuinely suffer from their disorder, but they create a significant burden on the health-care system. </strong>
<strong style="color:blue">Research suggests that hypochondriacs fall into three categories: those who have a variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder, those whose hypochondria was triggered by a stressful life event, and those who are hypersensitive to any physical symptoms. </strong>
<strong style="color:black">Cognitive therapy, in which patients are trained to any direct their attention away from their symptoms, and antidepressant medication both seem helpful in treating hypochondria. </strong>
<strong style="color:green">The most difficult part of treatment is suggesting that a patient suffers from hypochondria without angering or embarrassing him or her. </strong>
